Make sure that you have specified **Shows URL** under settings for your federation in app.equipe.com.
{: .info }

You only need to return current shows. The user will be able to choose a show to import from this list. This url should only return shows for the organizer that is making the request, specified by the **X-FEDERATION-ORGANIZER-ID** request header.

The response must validate json-schema [shows.json](https://app.equipe.com/api/schemas/shows.json)

Attribute | Type | Mandatory | Description
--- | :---: | :---: | ---
id | integer | Yes | Your primary key for the show

ends_on | string | No | ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD) formatted end date
entries_url | url | Yes | Full url including protocol, host and path to the Entries end point for the given show
